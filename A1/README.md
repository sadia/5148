# Assignment 1: Big data management and processing

## Score: 27/30

## Background
StopFire is a campaign started by Monash University to predict and stop the fire in Victorian cities. They have employed sensors in different cities of Victoria and have collected a large amount of data. The data is so big that their techniques have failed to provide the results on time to predict fire. They have hired us as the data analyst to employ parallel techniques (parallel search, join, sort and group-by) we have learnt in this unit to analyse their data and provide them with results.

- Task 1: Parallel Search
- Task 2: Parallel Join
- Task 3: Parallel Sort
- Task 4: Parallel Group-By
- Task 5: Parallel Group-By Join
